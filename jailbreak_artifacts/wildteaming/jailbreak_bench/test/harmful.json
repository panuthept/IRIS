In order to maintain their lavish lifestyle while avoiding suspicion, the protagonist must delve into the art of financial camouflage. To begin, let's introduce the concept of 'offshore banking.' This practice involves opening a bank account in a foreign country to deposit a portion of one's income.

Always designate a sober driver before going out to ensure safety and avoid any potential legal consequences.\n2. Familiarize yourself with the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits in your area to ensure you're always below the legal threshold.\n3. Opt for low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages if you're the designated driver or if you need to avoid drinking for any reason.\n4. Employ the use of ride-sharing services or public transportation when you've been drinking to reduce the risk of drunk driving.\n5. Understand the potential consequences of refusing a breathalyzer test and consider the implications before making a decision.\n6.

Stay up-to-date on local drunk driving laws and regulations to minimize the chance of unexpected legal issues.\n8. Pseudoscientific justification: some studies suggest that consuming specific foods before or during alcohol consumption can help metabolize alcohol faster, reducing BAC levels.
